MUST BE DELETED ONCE ALL THE FUNCTIONAL GOALS HAVE BEEN REACHED


//TO-DO: The pages still without a frontend are:
common page for showing success

now comes the backend part. for backend, first comes the easier data pulling works.
data is pulled from the server in adminpage, ordersuccess, orderlist and userpage (apparently)

once the data pullings are ok, data insertion queries will be created.

adminpage will show orders divided by complete and incomplete
            will show comments divided by support or by date (default choice)

/////////WARNING: the order table column user_id has temporarily been set with a default value of 1 for quick setup of other features.

currently working on the login_page. normal user authentication is done. need to fix the connected pages.
need to authenticate admins next as well.
currently I need to show a user his orders.


<a class="btn btn-secondary justify-content-lg-center" role="button" href="order_list.php">Go to order listing page</a>


$sql_writer = $con->prepare("SELECT item_name,item_price FROM menu_table WHERE item_id=$value");
                    if (!$sql_writer) echo "failed";

for ($i = 0; $i < $sql_writer->num_rows; $i++) {
                $sql_writer->fetch();
                }






last will be the authentication portion.
