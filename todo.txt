//TO-DO: The pages still without a frontend are:
common page for showing success

now comes the backend part. for backend, first comes the easier data pulling works.
data is pulled from the server in adminpage, ordersuccess, orderlist and userpage (apparently)

once the data pullings are ok, data insertion queries will be created.

adminpage will show orders divided by complete and incomplete
            will show comments divided by support or by date (default choice)

/////////WARNING: the order table column user_id has temporarily been set with a default value of 1 for quick setup of other features.




<a class="btn btn-secondary justify-content-lg-center" role="button" href="order_list.php">Go to order listing page</a>

$con = new mysqli("localhost","root","","xyz_order_db");
if($con->connect_error) die("Connection to database has failed");

$sql_writer = $con->prepare("SELECT item_name,item_price FROM menu_table WHERE item_id=$value");
                    if (!$sql_writer) echo "failed";

for ($i = 0; $i < $sql_writer->num_rows; $i++) {
                $sql_writer->fetch();
                }






last will be the authentication portion.
