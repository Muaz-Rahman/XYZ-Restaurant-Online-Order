MUST BE DELETED ONCE ALL THE FUNCTIONAL GOALS HAVE BEEN REACHED


//TO-DO: The pages still without a frontend are:
common page for showing success

now comes the backend part. for backend, first comes the easier data pulling works.
data is pulled from the server in adminpage, ordersuccess, orderlist and userpage (apparently)

once the data pullings are ok, data insertion queries will be created.

adminpage will show orders divided by complete and incomplete
            will show comments divided by support or by date (default choice)

/////////WARNING: the order table column user_id has temporarily been set with a default value of 1 for quick setup of other features.
checkout ---> order_success
ordersuccess will show the order that has just been completed by the user. will take form data from checkout.php
ordersuccess will both show some values AND create another entry in the order table
for order success, I need to show names of the item and quantity of the item
will have to calculate the sum total of the order. for that I also need the unit price as well














last will be the authentication portion.
