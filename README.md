# XYZ-Restaurant-Online-Ordering-System

An online food ordering system for an imaginary restaurant named XYZ. The website displays the user menu list of the day, a contact form for feedbacks and most importantly, the page that allows them to add foods to their carts and then order them once finished.

The admin page(s) allow the admin to view the list of orders that are pending and update them as completed and view the completed orders, update the current menu that is being displayed to the customers, add a new item and view the list of feedbacks (divided into normal feedback messages and support messages).

The sql_script folder contains an existing database which can be directly imported in phpmyadmin by creating a database named xyz_order_db.
