# XYZ-Restaurant-Online-Ordering-System

An online food ordering system for an imaginary restaurant named XYZ. The website displays the user menu list of the day, a contact form for feedbacks and most importantly, the page that allows them to add foods to their carts and then order them once finished.

The sql_script folder contains an existing database which can be directly imported in phpmyadmin by creating a database named xyz_order_db.
